As children of Sámi reindeer herders, the Swedish state has mandated they attend a "nomad school" where they are forbidden to speak their native language. As the children visit home only sporadically, their parents know little about the abuse they face, much of it at the hands of the housemother, Rita. Those who dare to speak up are silenced. Thirty years later, the five children have chosen different paths to cope with the past. Else-Maj holds strong in her Sámi identity but has turned to religion for comfort, while Anne-Risten now goes by Anne to hide her heritage from friends. Nilsa herds reindeer like his father but harbors a lot of anger, and Jon-Ante struggles with traumatic memories from the school. Then there's Marge, who is about to adopt a daughter from Colombia, but can't help questioning if it's right to take a child from her homeland. Then suddenly, housemother Rita reappears. Now an old, frail woman claiming to have God on her side, she acts like nothing ever happened. But the five former students have neither forgotten nor forgiven her. As the narrative shifts between each of their perspectives, the novel asks: If you had the chance to punish the person who hurt you as a child, would you? Based on the author's family story, Punished is a searing novel about loss, memory, cultural erasure, and community that vibrates with righteous rage over one nation's greatest betrayals of its native people"--cProvided by publisher.  aElectronic reproduction.bNew YorkcScribnerd2025nAvailable via World Wide Web. 7aNovels.2lcgft 0aElectronic books.1 aWillson-Broyles, Rachel,etranslator.2 aOverDrive, Inc.,edistributor.08iOnline version:aLaestadius, Ann-Helén.tPunisheddNew York : Scribner, 2025z9781668045527w(DLC) 202403370640zClick here to accessuhttp://link.overdrive.com/?websiteID=200561&titleID=1082444140zClick here to access excerptuhttps://samples.overdrive.com/?crid=728a6074-e74d-4c6b-986f-0b97f7968ac2&.epub-sample.overdrive.com01691cam a2200409 i 4500001001400000003000400014005001700018006001900035007001500054008004100069020003500110037008400145040002300229050002600252082002800278100003800306245004500344264005000389264001100439300002200450336002600472337002600498338003600524347001900560380002000579380001700599385002300616500002100639520018700660533010300847655003400950655001900984655002201003710003501025856008701060856013401147erc0001287060TLC20250107081823.0m        d        cr unu||||||||250107t20252025nyu     o     000 1 eng d  a9780374613907 (electronic bk.)  a2433B89F-F28F-4438-B9D8-A426A4CC6D81bOverDrive, Inc.nhttp://www.overdrive.com  aTLCcTLCdTLCerda00aPS3614.E582bS64 202500a813/.6223/eng/202407261 aNewell, Brittany,d1994-eauthor.10aSoft core :ba novel /cBrittany Newell. 1aNew York :bFarrar, Straus and Giroux,c2025. 4c©2025  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rda  aFiction2marcgt  aeBook2tlcgt  aGeneral2tlctarget  aElectronic book.  a"A stripper's madcap search for her missing ex-boyfriend takes her over the edge in this whip-smart, wildly funny novel about love, sex, work, and sex work"--cProvided by publisher.  aElectronic reproduction.bNew YorkcFarrar, Straus and Girouxd2025nAvailable via World Wide Web. 7aPsychological fiction.2lcgft 7aNovels.2lcgft 0aElectronic books.2 aOverDrive, Inc.,edistributor.40zClick here to accessuhttp://link.overdrive.com/?websiteID=200561&titleID=1070218840zClick here to access excerptuhttps://samples.overdrive.com/?crid=2433b89f-f28f-4438-b9d8-a426a4cc6d81&.epub-sample.overdrive.com02381cam a2200421 i 4500001001400000003000400014005001700018006001900035007001500054008004100069020003500110037008400145040002300229050002600252082002800278100003100306245005300337246001700390264005700407300002200464336002600486337002600512338003600538347001900574380002000593380001700613385002300630500002100653520072900674533009101403655002801494655001901522655002201541710003501563776014001598856008701738856013401825erc0001244887TLC20240712221150.0m        d        cr unu||||||||240712s2025    ilu     o     000 1 eng d  a9781464221255 (electronic bk.)  aEBE50F5D-A045-4793-9C09-82CE18D5014AbOverDrive, Inc.nhttp://www.overdrive.com  aTLCcTLCdTLCerda00aPS3602.U876bF67 202500a813/.6223/eng/202404291 aButler, Nickolas,eauthor.12aA forty year kiss :ba novel /cNickolas Butler.3 a40 year kiss 1aNaperville, Illinois :bSourcebooks Landmark,c2025.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rda  aFiction2marcgt  aeBook2tlcgt  aGeneral2tlctarget  aElectronic book.  a"Charlie and Vivian parted ways after just four years of marriage. Too many problems, too many struggles. When Charlie returns to Wisconsin forty years later, he's not sure what he'll find. He is sure of one thing-he must try to reconnect with Vivian to pick up the broken pieces of their past. But forty years is a long time. It's forty years of other relationships, forty years of building new lives, and forty years of long-held regrets, mistakes, and painful secrets. An accomplished exploration of starting over and sunset triumph, A Forty-Year Kiss is a novel in the tradition of Kent Haruf's Our Souls at Night.

That it made you sit differently in your own skin? A book that complicated everything you believed in and changed the way you read the world around you forever? This is what Sarah Chihaya calls a "Life Ruiner". Sarah's Life Ruiner was The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. When she read it in her high school English class, she could no longer pretend not to notice how alien she felt as a Japanese American in a predominantly White suburb of Cleveland. Shaken, she set out on a quest-for the book that would show her who she was and how to live in an inhospitable world. There were lots of scripts available, and she tried to follow them-skinny athlete, angsty artist, ambitious academic. But a lifelong struggle with depression thwarted the resolution to every plot, and when she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown, the world became an unreadable blank page. In the aftermath, she was faced with a question: can we ever truly rewrite the stories that govern our lives? Alternately searing and laugh-out-loud funny, Bibliophobia is a deft combination of memoir and criticism in the vein of Geoff Dyer and Olivia Laing. Through a series of books, including The Bluest Eye, Anne of Green Gables, Possession, A Tale for the Time Being, and The Last Samurai, Sarah Chihaya interrogates her cultural identity, her relationship with depression, and the necessary and painful ways that books can push back on the readers who love them"--cProvided by publisher.0 aBibliophobia -- Canadian world -- Cut, shuffle, cut -- The non-existent pelt -- A glass essay -- A tale for nonbeing -- Unquiet graves -- Epilogue.

Step two: Orphan acquires caretakers who amplify the world's cruelty. Step three: Orphan escapes and goes on an adventure, encountering the world's vast possibilities. The Sun Won't Come Out Tomorrow upends this. Pairing powerful critiques of popular orphan narratives, from Annie to the Boxcar Children to Party of Five, journalist Kristen Martin explores the real history of orphan-hood in the United States, from the 1800s to the present. Martin reveals the religious charity and mission that was the core of the first orphanages (one that soon changed to profit), the orphan trains that took parentless children out West (often without a choice), and the inherent racism that still underlies the United States' approach to child welfare. Through a combination of in-depth archival research, memoir (Martin herself lost both her parents when she was quite young), and cultural analysis, The Sun Won't Come out Tomorrow is a compellingly-argued, compassionate book that forces us to reconsider autonomy, family, and community. Kristen Martin delivers a searing indictment of America's consistent inability to care for those who most need it"--cProvided by publisher.  aElectronic reproduction.bNew YorkcPublicAffairsd2025nAvailable via World Wide Web. 0aOrphanszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aAbandoned childrenzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aOrphanageszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aChild welfarezUnited StatesxHistory. 0aElectronic books.2 aOverDrive, Inc.,edistributor.08iOnline version:aMartin, Kristen.tSun won't come out tomorrowbFirst edition.dNew York, NY : Bold Type Books, 2025z9781645030362w(DLC) 202401920040zClick here to accessuhttp://link.overdrive.com/?websiteID=200561&titleID=1082310940zClick here to access excerptuhttps://samples.overdrive.com/?crid=b82140a6-5bc1-425c-bbef-70bd7faf4d71&.epub-sample.overdrive.com02688cam a2200409 i 4500001001400000003000400014005001700018006001900035007001500054008004100069020003500110037008400145040002300229050002700252082002800279100003100307245004800338264005300386300002200439336002600461337002600487338003600513347001900549380002000568380001700588385002300605500002100628520107800649533009201727655003101819655001901850655002201869710003501891776013101926856008702057856013402144erc0001294233TLC20250131220049.0m        d        cr unu||||||||250131s2025    mnu     ob    000 1 eng d  a9781644453209 (electronic bk.)  a7699A139-1B05-4E93-A6A5-630903FD5F85bOverDrive, Inc.nhttp://www.overdrive.com  aTLCcTLCdTLCerda00aPR9375.9.R35bD57 202504a823.92223/eng/202406241 aRakhā, Yūsuf,eauthor.14aThe dissenters :ba novel /cYoussef Rakha. 1aMinneapolis, Minnesota :bGraywolf Press,c2025.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rda  aFiction2marcgt  aeBook2tlcgt  aGeneral2tlctarget  aElectronic book.  a"Amna, Nimo, Mouna-these are all names for a single Egyptian woman whose life has mirrored that of her country. After her death in 2015, her son, Nour, ascends to the attic of their house where he glimpses her in a series of ever more immersive visions: Amna as a young woman forced into an arranged marriage in the 1950s, a coquettish student of French known to her confidants as Nimo, a self-made divorcee and a lover, a "pious mama" donning her hijab, and, finally, a feminist activist during the Arab Spring. Charged and renewed by these visions of a woman he has always known as Mouna, Nour begins a series of fevered letters to his sister-who has been estranged from Mouna and from Egypt for many years-in an attempt to reconcile what both siblings know about this mercurial woman, their country, and the possibility for true revolution after so much has failed.

Orphaned by the age of five, Marguerite de la Rocque was heir to a chateau with its own village and lands. But her guardian, Jean Francois de la Rocque de Roberval, sells Marguerite's property to embark on an expedition to New France, bringing Marguerite and her maidservant with him. Aboard the ship, the women are limited to the company of the captain, the navigator, Roberval, and his secretary--a man whose musical talent, literary knowledge, and dark eyes intrigue Marguerite. It isn't long before the two of them are meeting secretly to declare their love for one another. When Roberval discovers this transgression, he is furious, seeing their affection as betrayal. As punishment, he maroons them on a small island off the coast, condemning them to certain death. Marguerite, the man she considers to be her husband, and her servant create a home for themselves inside a small cave. When the weather turns and the island is blanketed in ice, survival becomes nearly impossible. Marguerite is soon the only one left alive. She despairs, convinced she's been abandoned by God, and that she, too, will succumb to the brutality of the Island. Only then does she realize a strength her guardian could never have fathomed. She teaches herself to hunt and fish, to preserve food, and to scavenge. Months pass, and eventually Marguerite is discovered by a group of Basque fisherman. She persuades them to return her to France, where she tells her story and finally secures her own future, free from her guardian's control"--cProvided by publisher.  aElectronic reproduction.bNew YorkcRandom House Publishing Groupd2025nAvailable via World Wide Web. 7aNovels.2lcgft 0aElectronic books.2 aOverDrive, Inc.,edistributor.08iOnline version:aGoodman, Allegra.tIsolabFirst edition.dNew York : The Dial Press, 2025.z9780593730096w(DLC) 202400602440zClick here to accessuhttp://link.overdrive.com/?websiteID=200561&titleID=1071435240zClick here to access excerptuhttps://samples.overdrive.com/?crid=68de7a2c-935d-4973-a103-58a698297299&.epub-sample.overdrive.com01849cam a2200445 i 4500001001400000003000400014005001700018006001900035007001500054008004100069020003500110037008400145040002300229050002900252082003300281100003200314245005100346264003400397300002200431336002600453337002600479338003600505347001900541380002200560380001700582385002300599500002100622520010600643533010200749600002300851600004900874650004200923650002300965650002000988655002201008710003501030776011701065856008701182856013401269erc0001283046TLC20241219221843.0m        d        cr unu||||||||241219s2025    nyu     o     000 0aeng d  a9780593653999 (electronic bk.)  a34D42CD3-C0F2-4E1A-9B55-85806E0F09BEbOverDrive, Inc.nhttp://www.overdrive.com  aTLCcTLCdTLCerda00aPR9619.3.B7153bZ46 202500a823/.914aB223/eng/202410281 aBrooks, Geraldine,eauthor.10aMemorial days :ba memoir /cGeraldine Brooks. 1a[New York] :bViking,c[2025]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rda  aBiography2marcgt  aeBook2tlcgt  aGeneral2tlctarget  aElectronic book.  a"A heartrending and beautiful memoir of sudden loss and a journey to peace"--cProvided by publisher.  aElectronic reproduction.bNew YorkcPenguin Publishing Groupd2025nAvailable via World Wide Web.10aBrooks, Geraldine.10aHorwitz, Tony,d1958-2019xDeath and burial. 0aWomen authors, AustralianvBiography. 0aWidowsvBiography. 0aGrief in women. 0aElectronic books.2 aOverDrive, Inc.,edistributor.08iOnline version:aBrooks, Geraldine.tMemorial daysd[New York] : Viking, [2025]z9780593653999w(DLC) 202403025240zClick here to accessuhttp://link.overdrive.com/?websiteID=200561&titleID=1071435840zClick here to access excerptuhttps://samples.overdrive.com/?crid=34d42cd3-c0f2-4e1a-9b55-85806e0f09be&.epub-sample.overdrive.com
